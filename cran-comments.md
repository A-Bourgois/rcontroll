## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant "Package for" at the start of the title
* Extended the description of the package in the field description to one paragraph
* Added \value to pipe.Rd, trollsim.Rd and trollstack.Rd
* Replaced \dontrun by \donttest in troll.Rd, and stack.Rd

I have not added a reference for the method because we are waiting for CRAN acceptance 
before submitting it to Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 
But I will add a reference as soon as a paper describing the method is accepted.

I have included all the people concerned in the Authors@R field 
and included everyone as authors. 
Indeed, J. Chave, I. MarÃ©chaux and F. Fischer developed the C++ code in src,
and S. Schmitt and G. Salzet developed the R code.

## Test environments 

* local, Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS, R 3.6.3
* GitHub Actions, Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS, R 3.6
* GitHub Actions, Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS, R-release
* GitHub Actions, macOS latest, R-release
* R-hub builder, Windows, R-release

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [11s] NOTE
    Uses the superseded package: 'doSNOW (>= 1.0.10)'
    
We use doSNOW to pass the progress bar to foreach as described in their package:
"the snow options are passed to foreach using the .options.snow argument". 
We currently have no alternative as explained here:
