\description{
TROLL is coded in C++ to efficiently simulate typically hundreds of thousands
of individuals over hundreds of years. The rcontroll package is a wrapper of
TROLL that includes functions in R that generate inputs and prepare the run,
run simulations, and analyse the outputs through tables, figures, and maps
taking advantage of the R package ecosystem.
}
\section{Pre-simulations}{
 \describe{ Pre-simulation functions include global
  parameters definition (generate_parameters function), optional definition
  of lidar parameters (generate_lidar function), and climate data generation
  (generate_climate function). rcontroll also includes default data for
  species and climate inputs for a typical French Guiana rainforest.  The
  purpose of the generate_climate function with the help of the corresponding
  vignette is to calculate TROLL climate inputs from ERA5-Land (Mu√±oz-Sabater
  et al. 2021), a global climatic reanalysis dataset. Therefore, rcontroll
  users only need species-specific data to run TROLL simulations anywhere in
  the tropics. The definition of the lidar parameters (generate_lidar
  function) is optional but allows the user to add an aerial lidar simulation
  for a time step defined in the TROLL simulation to obtain a corresponding
  point cloud. }

\section{Simulations}{
 \describe{ Simulations are run one at a time using the
  troll function or as stacked runs, using the stack function. The outputs of
  the two commands are stored in trollsim or trollstack classes,
  respectively; they can be accessed using object attributes (with @ in R) in
  the form of simple R objects. trollsim or trollstack objects consist of 9
  attributes: (1) simulation name, (2) path to saved files, (3) simulation
  parameters, (4) simulation inputs, (5) simulation log, (6) initial and
  final state of the forest, (7) ecosystem metrics, (8) species metrics, and
  optionally (9) point clouds from aerial lidar simulations. The initial and
  final states of the simulated forest are represented by a table that
  records the spatial position, size and other relevant traits of all trees
  at the beginning and end of the simulation. The ecosystem and species
  metrics are summaries of ecosystem processes and states , such as  net
  primary productivity and aboveground biomass, and provided both at
  species-level and aggregated over the entire stand. Point clouds from
  aerial lidar simulations are stored as LAS using the R package lidR
  (Roussel et al., 2020). Simulations can be saved using a user-defined path
  when run and later loaded as a simple simulation (load_output function) or
  a stack of simulations (load_stack function). }

\section{Post-simulations}{
 \describe{ rcontroll also includes
  post-simulations functions. Simulation outputs can be retrieved simply from
  trollsim or trollstack objects and summarised or plotted in the R
  environment with the print, summary and autoplot functions. The
  miscellaneous get_chm function allows users to quickly retrieve canopy
  height models from aerial lidar point clouds. In addition, a function is
  available to visualise TROLL simulations as an animated figure (autogif
  function) for research, demonstration or educational purposes. }
